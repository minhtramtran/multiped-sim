Multi-pedestrian VR Simulator

**Overview**

MultiPed-Sim is a VR simulator designed for evaluating the external communication of autonomous vehicles in multi-pedestrian scenarios. This tool was developed as part of the research presented in the paper "Evaluating Autonomous Vehicle External Communication using a Multi-Pedestrian VR Simulator," published at: https://doi.org/10.1145/3678506

**Current Repository Contents**

While we prepare the full Unity project for open-access release—by removing unused and licensed 3D assets—we are providing the scripts used in the simulator for research purposes. These scripts are integral to the functioning of the simulator.

**Planned Updates**

We are committed to supporting open science initiatives and plan to upload the entire Unity project. Accompanying documentation will be provided to facilitate the use of the simulator in other research projects.
